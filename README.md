# Multidapter

The Multidapter gem's purpose is to simplify the task of connecting and exchanging data between systems by providing a single, uniform interface for developers to access and use various network protocols.  Multidapter's structure is based on the [AsyncAPI specification 2.0.0](https://www.asyncapi.com/docs/specifications/2.0.0/) and it uses a consistent command/event pattern for managing servers, connections and message exchange.  Using configuration options, applications can quickly and securely access network endpoints and establish communications between services.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'multidapter'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install multidapter

## Usage

### Overview

Microservices, Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) and other modern technology designs are predicated on building independent services that connect and exchange information over the network.  How to go about enabling this core service-to-service communication however leads to the system architect's dirty secret: key data message exchange strategies are enabled or blocked by this decision.  And because nearly every system component depends upon the shared messaging framework, this choice is a significant factor for system performance, system reliability and ultimately development and operation costs.  

Orchestration and Choreography are the two principle data message exchange strategies.  Like a conductor leading a group of musicians, the Orchestration model uses a central service to route, sequence and exchange messages between services.  Mulesoft, Apache Camel and other Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) solutions are examples of Orchestration brokers.  The Choreography strategy is a distributed model, more like independent dancers who follow routines and coordinate with one another to complete their tasks.  Each approach has its associated pros and cons.

Multidapter is designed to support both strategies.  By turning the model on its head and embueing the distributed services with a configurable, protocol-agnostic way to exchange messages, developers may use existing protocols to integrate legacy systems and others to support new components, switching methods as circumstances change.

#### AsyncAPI

Uses Adapter pattern to provide uniform interface 
Uses AyncApi for organizing and representing network integration components
Uses Dry gems to practice clean architecutre




#### AMQP Example
1. Create node for application
1. connect to a server
1. connect to server and access api
1. post message to an Exchange
1. bind to a queue and collect a message
1. bind to a queue and ack a message


### Node

Node is a singleton

```
Node = Multidapter::Node.new(id)
Node.configure() do |conf|
  conf.id       = "<application_name>"
  conf.asyncapi = "2.0"

  conf.title        = "<application_name>"
  conf.version      = "1.0"
  conf.description  = ""


  conf.servers  = [
    LogServer   = "",
    SmtpServer  = "",
  ]

  conf.channels = []

  log_channel   = connection_adapter.open_channel(log_producer_channel)
  smtp_channel  = connection_adapter.open_channel(smtp_producer_channel)
end
```

### ConnectionAdapter

```
my_uri = URI("amqp://guest:guest@vm188.dev.megacorp.com/profitd.qa")

amqp_conn     = Multidapter::Server.connect
log_channel   = amqp_conn.open_channel()
log_messageq  = log_channel.build_message()
result        = log_message.post()

amqp_server_binding_options = {}
amqp_server_url = URI("amqp://guest:guest@vm188.dev.megacorp.com/")
amqp_server = Multidapter::Server.add(amqp_server_url, amqp_server_binding_options)
amqp_conn = amqp_server.connect(amqp_server_url, amqp_server_binding_options)

result = amqp_conn.test_connection

...

amqp_conn.close

# ServerConnection supports blocks

amqp_server_binding_options = {}
amqp_server = Multidapter::Server.add(amqp_server_url, amqp_server_binding_options)
Multidapter::Server.connect(amqp_server_url, amqp_server_binding_options) do |amqp_conn|
  event_publish_channel     = amqp_conn.open_channel(event_producer_channel_def)
  event_subscribe_channel   = amqp_conn.open_channel(event_consumer_channel_def)

  service_client_channel    = amqp_conn.open_channel(consumer_listener_channel_def)
  service_reply_to_channel  = amqp_conn.open_channel(producer_reply_to_channel_def)

  enrollment_event_message.create() do |message|
    message.content_type  = "application/json"
    message.payload       = { text: "Hello world" }
  end

  enrollment_event_message.send(event_publish_channel)            # Message is PORO that includes Multidapter::Message
  enrollment_event_message.send_scheduled(event_publish_channel)  # class Includes Multidapter::Message
end


event_publish_channel.configure do |conf|

end
```
      producer_endpoint       = AmqpQueue.new(key, options)
      event_post_channel      = amqp_connection.add_channel(event_publish_endpoint)
      post                    = event_post_channel.schedule_message(message)
      event_subscribe_channel = amqp_connection.add_channel(event_subscribe_endpoint)
      amqp_connection.close

    endpoint = Multidapter::Endpoint.new(host: "127.0.0.1")
    amqp_server = Multidapter::Server.new(endpoint)
    amqp_producer_adapter = Multidapter::Adapters::AmqpProducerAdapter.new
    amqp_producer_channel = Multidapter::Adapters::AmqpProducerChannel.new

    producer_endpoint =

      amqp_producer_connection = Multidapter::Connections::AmqpProducerConnection.new(endpoint, exchange, options)
    producer_connection = Multidapter::Connection.new(amqp_producer_connection)

    amqp_consumer_connection = Multidapter::Connections::AmqpConsumerConnection.new(endpoint, queue, options)
    consumer_connection = Multidapter::Connection.new(amqp_consumer_connection)


    channel_options =

      consumer_connection.add_channel(endpoint, channel_options)

    event_channel = connection.open_channel(:enterprise_events)
    event_channel.post_message()
    event_channel.schedule_message()
    event_channel.retrieve_message()


    http_connection = Multidapter::Connection.new(http_connection)

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
